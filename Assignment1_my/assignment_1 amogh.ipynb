    "# IDS Assignment Part 1 - <font color=\"red\"><h7>Deadline: 18/12/2022 23:59</h7></font>\n",
    "This is the first part of the assignments in IDS 2022/2023. \n",
    "Please use this Jupyter notebook to work on the questions posed in the assignment. When you are done, upload the notebook in Moodle at the designated activity. This is the _only_ file that is required. A separate report is _not_ needed and will not be considered for grading. \n",
    "\n",
    "Give your commented Python code and answers in the corresponding provided cells. Make sure to answer all questions in a clear and explicit manner and discuss your outputs. _Please do not change the general structure of this notebook_. You can, however, add additional markdown or code cells if necessary. <b>Please DO NOT CLEAR THE OUTPUT of the notebook you are submitting! </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"red\"> *Please make sure to include the names and matriculation numbers of all group members in the slot provided below.* </font> If a name or a student id is missing, the student will not receive any points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 1: While working on the assignment, you will get a better understanding of the dataset. Feel free to generate additional results and visualizations to support your answers. For example, this might be useful regarding data modification, data simplification, or output interpretation. <font color=\"red\">Ensure that all your claims are supported.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 2: <font color=\"red\">Plan your time wisely. </font> A few parts of this assignment may take some time to run. It might be necessary to consider time management when you plan your group work. Also, do not attempt to upload your assignment at the last minute before the deadline. This often does not work, and you will miss the deadline. Late submissions will not be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 3: RWTHmoodle allows multiple submissions, with every new submission overwriting the previous one. <b>Partial submissions are therefore possible and encouraged. </b> This might be helpful in case of technical issues with RWTHMoodle, which may occur close to the deadline."
